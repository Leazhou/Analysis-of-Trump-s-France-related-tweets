This work was carried out during the 2nd capstone/projet of the Data Analyst formation delivered by Lepont (https://www.lepont-learning.com). The team was formed by Fatima-Ezzahra DEBRAY, Charl√®ne DORIZON and me (Changwei ZHOU). The notebook uploaded in github is written by me except one small part (stated clearly in the notebook).

The display of the notebook is not well supported in github, one can use nbviewer.org to get a better display. https://nbviewer.org/github/Leazhou/Analysis-of-Trump-s-France-related-tweets/blob/main/Twitter_all_tweets_archive.ipynb
